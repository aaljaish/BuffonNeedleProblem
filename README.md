# BuffonNeedleProblem
This post estimates the constant Pi by "tossing" needles at a board with equal-sized lines separated by equal width (Figure 1) and counting the number of times the needles intersect a line. This is called "Buffon's needle problem" and it was posed by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon: 

Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?
